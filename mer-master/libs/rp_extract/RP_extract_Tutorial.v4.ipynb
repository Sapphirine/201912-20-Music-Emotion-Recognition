The feature extraction process for the Rhythm Patterns is composed of two stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the specific loudness sensation in different frequency bands is computed, by using a Short Time FFT, grouping the resulting frequency bands to psycho-acoustically motivated critical-bands, applying spreading functions to account for masking effects and successive transformation into the decibel, Phon and Sone scales. This results in a power spectrum that reflects human loudness sensation (Sonogram).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second step, the spectrum is transformed into a time-invariant representation based on the modulation frequency, which is achieved by applying another discrete Fourier transform, resulting in amplitude modulations of the loudness in individual critical bands. These amplitude modulations have different effects on human hearing sensation depending on their frequency, the most significant of which, referred to as fluctuation strength, is most intense at 4 Hz and decreasing towards 15 Hz. From that data, reoccurring patterns in the individual critical bands, resembling rhythm, are extracted, which – after applying Gaussian smoothing to diminish small variations – result in a time-invariant, comparable representation of the rhythmic patterns in the individual critical bands."
